# Module 1 Final Project
## The Project

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.
Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

### Questions
# 1. What are the most popular movie genres on TMDB?
# 2. What are the most lucrative types of films?
# 3. How much do these movies cost to make?

--------------------------- 
# Question 1: What are the most popular movie genres on TMDB?

#As we can see from the list of TMDB's 25 Most Popular films, it is apparent that the most popular
#genres of films are Super Hero movies, Well-Known Series (non-Super Hero such as LOTR, Star Wars, etc.), and Children's movies.

#15 of the top 25 are Super Hero movies (60%)
#4 of the top 25 are Well-Known Series (16%)
#3 of the top 25 are Children's movies (12%)
#3 of the top 25 are one-off successful films (12%)

#The fact that Super Hero & Well-Known Series films makeup over 3/4 of TMDB's top 25 most popular movies
#is an incredibly compelling statistic if Microsoft decides to create new content.
#Unfortunately, Microsoft is late to this strategy and would thus have to be creative about how they
#could participate in creating these movies when Marvel Comic Universe, Sony, Universal and Disney all own the 
#vast majority of intellectual property rights for these film series.

---------------------------
# Question 2: What are the most lucrative types of films?

#Taking a look at the top 10 foreign and domestic grossing films, it is clear, though unsurprising, to see that 
#many of the most popular film categories are also the ones that make the most money. 

#40% (4) Super Hero Movies
#40% (4) Well-Known Series
#20% (2) Children's Movies

---------------------------
# Question 3: What are the most expensive movies to make?

#Among the most expensive movies to make, the majority fall into the same three categories as the most lucrative
#and popular films - Well-Known series, Super Hero movies, and Children's movies. 

---------------------------
# Conclusion

For Microsoft to begin creating movies that are going to be very popular and thus, lucrative, their avenues are limited. The chances of creating a one-off film that ends up being lucrative enough to justify the initial investment, although it is not impossible, is unlikely. More reasonably, Microsoft would need to figure out what their competitive advantage is when it comes to the film-creation business, of which owning the intellectual property of these consistently successful movies is not one of them.

I believe that within the context of joining the film industry, Microsoft's most valuable asset is that roughly 50-60 million people own some kind of an Xbox device. In this way, they are already in many peoples' livingrooms, so there may be a lucrative solution for them providing access to certain sets of movies they can offer for streaming.

# Recommendations

For all of the reasons described, I recommend that Microsoft does not get involved in creating new movie content. There may be legitimate business opportunities that they could create by distributing other companyies' content on their video game devices and even Windows operating system. None of these reasons, however, are compelling enough to me to support Microsoft moving into this new industry. Additionally, the opportunity cost of spending money on trying to create successful movies is signficiant, as the cash could be used to improve some of their services that are more dominant, such as GitHub.
